# Changelog

# 0.4.0

## For QA

- Please try to use new ground filter
- Report how hovering on aircraft feels now. It improves performance, but can be buggy and slow
- Aircraft turns are available not for all flights, and for some they've been cut. That will be improved in future, no need to report
- Please report general feel of aircraft turns. For now, they are only available for opened aircraft overlay

## Features and improvements

- Changed route aircraft icon color
- Added turns history (tracks) when you open pilot overlay
- METAR/TAF/NOTAMS redesign
- Renamed Airport info to Info & Weather to clarify what's in there
- Pilot ATC has been moved to separate tab
- You can now see CTAF frequency in pilot popup
- Added ?airport param to main page to quickly open any airport on map
- Whole Airport ATC card has been made clickable
- Navigraph AIRAC in bottom left corner is now clickable with useful info about how and why you need upgrading
- Redesigned ground aircraft filter

### Performance improvements and technical stuff

- Significantly improved map layer loading performance
- Reworked aircraft icon render - we are now able to change icon colors to be anything we want, not just predefined pngs
- Reduced memory consumption for sectors render. This change will be significant when many firs are currently active
- Improved performance when moving map (will be significant on low zoom levels)
- Airports points will no longer render on >100+ airports are on screen. This should improve performance on slow devices

## Bug fixes

- Fixed RU-SC ATIS detection
- Improved 1251 encoding detection
- Fixed fill of hovered approach facility not covering whole area

# 0.3.5

This is a small fix update while we still develop 0.4.0.

- You can now close this warning message in header
- Fixed NY_CL_FSS display, as well as other oceanic facilities detection issues

- Restored Discord icon in header

# 0.3.4

- Updated roadmap
- Vatsim has been uppercased to VATSIM everywhere
- Improved parsing logic for SimAware TRACON to some of the sectors, like SCT_APP, ESSEX_APP and CHI_X_APP

  Something may not work as it did before, so please keep an eye on approach sectors renders after this update. Overlall it should work better as before and be equal to SimAware.

And also previous changelogs missed that you can now open ATC card to view ATC stats. Give it a try!

# 0.3.3

- "View route" button will now reset "tracked" state
- Map will no longer autofocus on you if your aircraft has already arrived

# 0.3.0

This update adds airport overlay that you can use to get all possible info about airport you may need.

As always, remember to check Roadmap to get a hint of what's coming next! Stage 2 is getting closer to its end.

## Highlights

- üõ´ Airport Overlay: click on any airport to view its info
- üîÑ Redesign of approach sector label
- üì° ATIS encoding parsing improvements
- üîß UX improvements and bug fixes

## Airport Overlay

You can now click on any airport to view all of its available information.

Since this overlay contains probably too much info for a single popup, airport dashboard development is currently planned - you should expect it in near future.

What's included:

- METAR/TAF with basic info parsing
- NOTAMS with start/expiration dates
- VATSIM info if available with airport elevation, transition frequency and division
- CTAF frequency if no ATC is online for US airports
- All possible traffic list

Planned in future updates:

- Airport dashboard
- Filter map by airport traffic
- Add tracks to all of this airport traffic
- With all pilots' stats on single screen

## Features and improvements

- You will no longer see an alert when copying something - instead you'll notice text change
- Reduced traffic consumption when some FSS is online or controller has multiple sectors
- You can now properly move map below empty space with opened overlay. This should also allow using overlays on mobile
  phones (for those who uses them even when they are not yet properly supported)
- Redesigned approach sector label design. You will no longer suffer from random hovers, and it will be easier to differ sectors from each other when they are close to each other
- Reduced area sectors name size
- Removed decimals on pilot flown & remaining miles

## Bug fixes

- Updated ATIS encoding parse algorithm
- Moved Boeings 74* icons to B739 icon
- Added encoding parsing for pilots names
- Approach controller popup will now close more easily
- Pilot offline status should now properly reset after (s)he's back online
- Fixed error when aircraft was not listed in arrivals if arrival airport was same as departure

# 0.2.7

- Added runways on map. Their numbers and existence depend on your Navigraph subscription (you can see used AIRAC cycle for them in footer)
- You will now see Navigraph Data instead of Ultimate in Settings popup if you only bought data. This is cosmetic change only to reflect reality more

## Privacy features

- Removed full name from header
- Completely removed name from settings
- Added ability to customize name shown in header using settings
- You can now rename yourself in Discord using `/rename` command

# 0.2.6

This is a little update while we develop bigger one.

- Added little dot on bottom of airport without atc to highlight them on map
- Boeing 747 family will now be displayed as a340 instead of a320 (since they don't have their own icon yet)
- Replaced icon in pilot overlay popup in yet another attempt to stop it from crashing

# 0.2.5

- Added favicon
- Fixed error when sometimes overlay could break on aircraft type change
- Added cache reset for airplanes icons each update
- Added support of airports aliases
- Improved sort of ATC on departure: approach should now be higher than area atc when on ground

# 0.2.4

- Minified ATC airport card
- Added shadow for Area ATC card in light theme
- Added basic hover for approach controller selection
- Redesigned aircraft label
- Changed aircraft hover color
- Improved FSS color decision on light theme
- Fixed error when your hover overlay could be replaced by approach controller overlay for no reason
- Removed CartoDB labels to make map more clear. There will be a setting to enable them back in future

- Refactored airports data parsing for performance improvements. This fixes performance degradation introduced in
