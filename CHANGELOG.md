## Changelog

### Pilot overlay

You are now able to click on any aircraft (or flightplan prefile!) to enable it's overlay. From here you can open pilot on map, open Vatsim stats and more:

- Total time on network as pilot
- Pilot ID
- Speed/Alt/Heading
- Flight plan, including route and remarks plus stepclimbs
- Share pilot to instantly open card on map for anyone visiting your link
- View ATC where pilot currently flying - enabled by default for your own flights
- Enable tracking to make map follow this flight
- Aircraft dep/arr airports will also be highlighted

By default, overlays are replaced by pilot you open next - but you can also pin any overlay so it won't close.

This card can be auto-opened, pinned and tracked for your own flight - you can enable this in settings.

P.S. You are also able to open this from airport counters popup - including prefiles!
