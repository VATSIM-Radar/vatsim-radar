# 0.4.0

## Highlights

- 🛫 Airport Dashboard
- 🗺️ Aircraft History Turns
- 🌦️ Map Layers & Weather
- ✈️ New Aircraft Icons
- 🚀 Performance Improvements
- ✔️ UI/UX improvements and bug fixes

### Airport Dashboard

Brand-new Airport Dashboard is now available via permanent link on `/airport/icao` (can also be opened from airport
popup).

Dashboard is equipped for both pilots and controllers, with features that all of you could enjoy.

- View all airport info on the same screen
- View airport traffic - and filter it by type if you want - select all airborne, all on the ground or just departing.
- Enjoy Controller Mode, which will only leave aircraft on your screen, categorized by their type (you can also filter
  that)
- Toggle "show pilot stats" to quickly identify newbies from experienced folks
- Hide or expand map or columns - flexibility is everything!

We would also love feedback from all of you on this <3

### Aircraft History Turns

You can now see history of turns for any aircraft on map - colored almost like on FL24 for you to identify descend or
approx current aircraft altitude level just by looking at this line.

Turns are available when you open overlay or hover on aircraft.

They are also currently available if you toggle airport arriving tracks - but that's experimental, and we might disable
this in future for performance reasons (or make this Patreon feature!).

### Map Layers & Weather

Following new layers have been added:

- Satellite
- Jawg (dark theme only)
- OSM (light theme only)

Following weather layers have been added:

- Clouds (best visible in dark theme)
- Precipitation (OpenWeather has more coverage but worse looking, RainViewer - worse coverage, better looking)
- Wind

We had more plans for layers actually... but it turned out most layers are paid.

Since we can't afford paying for layers & weather now, you can support us on recently opened
Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/vatsimradar24

### New Aircraft Icons

Following aircraft icons have been hand-crafted for you - and our model matching has been updated to match new icons for
aircraft that don't have own yet.

- DA42, 62
- E170, 175, 190, 195
- EUFI
- H160, H47, PC12

- Reduced memory consumption for sectors render. This change will be significant when many firs are currently active
- Improved performance when moving map (will be significant on low zoom levels)
- Airports points will no longer render on >100+ airports are on screen. This should improve performance on slow devices

### Bug Fixes

## What's next?

On Friday myself & I will go on vacation which will last for a week. For that time, I will still try to fix critical
bugs that may occur - but nothing else.

After I come back, we have Map Settings and Filters, as well as context menu planned for 0.5.0 - and also some
improvements from suggestions section maybe.

Stage 2 is almost finished, at we'll have a prioritization session before we start Stage 3, and QA members list will be
extended. Stay tuned!

  it should work better as before and be equal to SimAware.

And also previous changelogs missed that you can now open ATC card to view ATC stats. Give it a try!

# 0.3.3

- "View route" button will now reset "tracked" state
- Map will no longer autofocus on you if your aircraft has already arrived

- 🔄 Redesign of approach sector label
- 📡 ATIS encoding parsing improvements
- 🔧 UX improvements and bug fixes

## Airport Overlay

You can now click on any airport to view all of its available information.

Since this overlay contains probably too much info for a single popup, airport dashboard development is currently
planned - you should expect it in near future.

What's included:

- METAR/TAF with basic info parsing
- NOTAMS with start/expiration dates
- VATSIM info if available with airport elevation, transition frequency and division
- CTAF frequency if no ATC is online for US airports

## Features and improvements

- You will no longer see an alert when copying something - instead you'll notice text change
- Reduced traffic consumption when some FSS is online or controller has multiple sectors
- You can now properly move map below empty space with opened overlay. This should also allow using overlays on mobile
  phones (for those who uses them even when they are not yet properly supported)

  sectors from each other when they are close to each other
- Reduced area sectors name size
- Removed decimals on pilot flown & remaining miles

## Bug fixes

- Updated ATIS encoding parse algorithm
- Moved Boeings 74* icons to B739 icon

- Removed CartoDB labels to make map more clear. There will be a setting to enable them back in future

# 0.2.3

This release summaries all hotfixes that was made today. Sorry for last days release spam :)

- Refactored airports data parsing for performance improvements. This fixes performance degradation introduced in
  today's 0.2.2 and makes performance even better than before 0.2.2
- Added SimAware TRACON Data as second source to fix Santiago Approach and some others: they will be displayed even if
  missing in VatSpy data

  sectors in many Russian airports)
- Added different color for approach sectors to highlight them in contrast with Area Control
