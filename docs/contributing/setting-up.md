# Setting Up

In order to get started with developing VATSIM Radar, please follow those steps. 

## Preliminary preparation

### Windows

Using Windows? I am too, very sorry for us all.

1. Install WSL 2.0. There is no other way for you
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. `git clone` project INSIDE of WSL. For example, create root folder named `/Projects` with proper permissions
   - Tip: use Windows Terminal from MS Store instead of default WSL terminal

### Linux

Make sure Docker is installed, otherwise you are good. Clone project whenever you want.

### MacOS

1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Running on ARM? In Docker Settings enable Virtual Machine Manager and VirtioFS for speed boosts
3. `git clone` project anywhere you want

## IDE

I prefer to work on WebStorm, but VS Code works just fine - just make sure to install all plugins needed (TS, Vue, Eslint, etc) and choose ESLint as your file formatter.

Also, later on, enable eslint and stylelint autofixes for better development.

Please do not use vim to develop this project.

## Getting it done

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` with no changes
2. **Working on Mac ARM64**? Run `docker compose build -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.arm64.yml`. Others skip this step
3. Run `docker compose up`
4. Visit `localhost:8080` in a few minutes. You should now be ready to do it

## Worth knowing

Hot Reload is not working for data-worker and vatglasses-worker. 

Making this simple: if you make changes for those files, you would have to restart containers that belong to them for changes to apply.

Changes made in Vue files or just main code will be auto-applied.
