# About Us

## What is VATSIM Radar?

VATSIM Radar is the go-to VATSIM Flight Tracker. It is a feature-rich tool that supports your flying or controlling experience!

## When was it created?

VATSIM Radar Beta was opened to the public on `17 April 2024`. That is the same day that Sean Bean turned 66. Coincidence? We think not.

## How is VATSIM Radar powered?

VATSIM Radar is built using Vue and Nuxt.
Our map is powered by OpenLayers, while our backend is Nitro, Prisma and MySQL. 

## How to support VATSIM Radar?
VATSIM Radar is funded by generous members of the community!
In order to keep VATSIM Radar running and support future development, we have set up a Patreon page. 

Funds will be used to pay for map layers, Cloudflare and Server traffic.

Donators get access to Early-Access branches, dedicated Discord channels to discuss and engage in the development, and their name showcased on our Patreon Appreciation page.
