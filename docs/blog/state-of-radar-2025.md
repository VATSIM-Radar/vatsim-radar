# State of Radar 2025

Hey all! Everybody is having their Rewind, so I should probably too.

Let's start with some stats. I had to apply database size increase recently due for it being too big... And when I looked inside, I was amazed.

## Stats

- 77k of people have logged in at least once. That's an absolute insane value. At least 28k of them have logged into VATSIM Radar within last month
- 21k of people have Navigraph Charts subscription, with 326 having Data Only Navigraph subscription
- More than 11k of favorite lists were created, with 850+ custom favorite lists
- People have saved 517 bookmarks and 227 filters (I should add some kind of achievement for that lol)
- More than 1500 custom map settings were saved
- In last 30 days, Radar outbound traffic was 56 terabytes with 2 billion API requests and 560k visits
- Top countries: US, Germany and UK
- Performance is overal good for 81% of visitors, with page fully loading in less than 1-2 seconds
- Most people open Radar from bookmarks/history/etc. I also see Google... but seriously? Bing? With 11k opens?
- Most popular browser is Chrome. Surprised to see Edge on second place!
- Shocking: most people open Radar from Windows

## This Year in Features

This was a huuge year for Radar! We've delivered:
- v1.0 with VATGlasses, Airports Layouts, Friends, Filters and Bookmarks
- v1.1 with SIGMETs, bookings and live stats
- v1.2 with NAVData on map (huuuge: aircraft route, procedures and more), distance tool and weather request
- A LOT of quality of life features - visit [changelog](https://docs.vatsim-radar.com/changelog.html) to check version history

## Your Support

Despite me having benefits for our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vatsimradar24) members, our monthly budget still covers almost twice of what we need to pay for cloud.

I can't thank you all enough - and I promise, you'll have more to come from me to thank you in coming year!

## What's next

I'll be working on VATSIM Radar v2.0 next year. I don't have ANY estimate, and this development could take months.

I think VATSIM Radar is in a pretty good state currently performance- and feature-wise, and I'll still publish small releases and hotfixes time to time while we develop 2.0.

### Confirmed for 2.0

- Partial redesign: new fonts, new colors, new design for various elements, more continuous UI look. New... logo?
- [Roadmap](https://vatsim-radar.com/roadmap) visual rework for clarity on what to expect in coming releases
- Hoppie integration
- Click/hover interactions rework across all elements on a map
- Settings 2.0: unified, proper-made and auto-saved settings as a separate page with a much better UI/UX

### Considering for 2.0 (or planned for future 2.x releases)

- StatSim integration for past-event tracks
- User personal page with flights history and much more
- Context (rmb) menu
- Desktop application w/ Discord Presence
- Patreon membership upgrades with exclusive features, such as faster updates, satellite layer, map layer with a better performance, and more
  - It's worth noting here, that "exclusive" features are also those we have to pay for

### 2.0 testing

This (huge) release will be tested in 3 phases:
- New selected Early Adopters testers joining - follow news in our [Discord](https://vatsim-radar.com/discord)
- All who applied for Early Adopters access
- Open Beta

Stay tuned! Thank you for being a part of this project.
